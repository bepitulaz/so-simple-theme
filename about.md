Hi there,

My name is Asep Bagja Priandana, you can call me Asep, and Bepitulaz is my nickname in the online world. I can develop a website, backend system and iOS app. PHP, Ruby, Javascript, and Objective-C are my main language to tackle most of the programming problems. But occasionally I’m using C++ too. Don’t ask me about Java, I can’t code with that language.

Now I live in Jakarta, Indonesia and work as a CTO and co-founder of my own digital marketing agency, the name is [Froyo Digital Analog](http://froyostory.com) (formerly was AmazingMilk). I love to travel anywhere. I’m very interested to talk about travel, tech, and music.
