Recently I have read 2 interesting articles about movement on the application development. The first is about <a title="Offline First Introduction" href="http://blog.hood.ie/2013/11/say-hello-to-offline-first/" target="_blank">Offline First</a>, and the second is about <a title="The Slow Web" href="http://theslowweb.com" target="_blank">Slow Web</a> movement. I like both concepts, because they can give the best experience to users, and, honestly they suit to my vision in application development. My vision is technology should help users whenever they need in every condition,while not turning them into technology slave.

I love traveling and I love coding, so I love to develop an app to help traveller (<a title="No Surprise Exercise" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ag7LEG1w4" target="_blank">no surprise</a>) <img src="http://asep.co/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> I have my own brand, named <a title="Travees App" href="http://traveesapp.com" target="_blank">Travees</a>. This brand&#8217;s focus is developing application for travellers. Currently, it has 2 products: the first one is Travees app (v1.0), a simple and free travel journal, and the second one is TBudget (Travees Budget) a budgeting app to track expense and debt for traveller or casual user. The latter will be launched soon on the App Store. Both of the apps is offline-first app. The reason why I made it as an offline app is simple; because when you go abroad, you can&#8217;t depend on the internet connection. Data roaming is very expensive. Therefore, a good strategy is to make an offline app, then synchronise all the data to the server later automatically when the app find a connection (by the way, this synchronise feature will be implemented in the next version of Travees and TBudget because they will use the same code <img src="http://asep.co/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> ).

Now, I&#8217;m trying to implement the slow web philosophy into the TBudget flow. The philosophy states that user should have a life. Users just need to input the budget limit and purpose then input the expense whenever they want and finally just forget about it. The app will remind them when the budget is nearly exceeded, and later send them expense report via email. I make TBudget because I need this kind of app. If the worst case no one wants to buy and download this app, I won&#8217;t regret it because I make it to solve my problem. I had tried several budgeting app and none suits my need.
