Today I&#8217;m starting a new blog again, after the old one was lost because of \*sigh\* something-bad-happen-and-I-don&#8217;t-want-to-remember-anymore \*sigh\*. All of the data was lost, and the panel domain of bepitulaz.com can&#8217;t be accessed. Ok, forget it, it did not matter. I&#8217;m considering to use my real name as a domain because of simplicity, and Asep is easier to pronounce than Bepitulaz for non-Indonesian. Am I right? <img src="http://asep.co/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> <!--more-->

I want to practice my English skill also, so maybe my post in this new blog will be more dominated with English than Bahasa Indonesia. But maybe occasionally I&#8217;ll post using Mandarin also, because I want to practice my Mandarin skill xD

By the way, thanks for visiting my blog. Enjoy <img src="http://asep.co/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
