Happy new year 2014! This post is not a resolution but some plans what I want to do in this year.

### 1. Digging deeper about Erlang and Elixir
This two functional programming languages is getting more attention from me than JVM based language. I should make at least one small project using this language.

### 2. Learning Riak
I have not jumped yet into NoSQL bandwagon. I think this year is a good year to start learning it. Why Riak? The reason is simple because I'm learning Erlang, therefore I want to learn a NoSQL written in Erlang.

### 3. Founding new startup that focus on product
Currently I have one, [FroyoStory](http://froyostory.com) a digital agency. Its service is give consultancy for the brand that want to do marketing in digital. But I still have a desire to create another one that focus in product and selling it to the customer, not consultant agency. My first little step to do that is founding [Midjournal](http://midjournal.com). It's a media startup.

That's all my plans in tech world for 2014.
