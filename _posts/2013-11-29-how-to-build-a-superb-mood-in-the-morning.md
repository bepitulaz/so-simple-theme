A short post for this great Friday. I want to share how to build a superb mood in the morning to boost productivity all day long <img src="http://asep.co/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> 

**1. Boil the water to make a cup of coffee (or tea if you don&#8217;t drink coffee).**

For today I choose a cappuccino to celebrate this beautiful morning instead of black coffee.

**2. Play your favourite music playlist.**

Ingrid Michaelson &#8211; You and I, is the first song to play today. It boost my productivity for May event :p

*&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry there, my honey. We might not have any money. But we&#8217;ve got our love to pay the bills. ~&#8221;*

**3. Enjoy**

The important part of this tutorial. Enjoy it.
