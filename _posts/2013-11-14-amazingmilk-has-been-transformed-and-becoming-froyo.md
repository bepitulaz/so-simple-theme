1 year 5 months ago, me and <a title="Follow him" href="http://twitter.com/alivano" target="_blank">Andika Alivano</a>Â started a digital agency in Jakarta, Indonesia. We were using AmazingMilk as its name. Many people asked us, &#8220;why Amazing Milk?&#8221; or &#8220;Milk? Why Milk?&#8221;, our answer was very simple, &#8220;because we love milk, and almost everybody loves milk also&#8221;. AmazingMilk were ran not only by both of us, there were 2 more co-founders. Those of 2 co-founders have an existing advertising agency in Jakarta, but their agency is not at the same business with AmazingMilk, it basically a traditional advertising agency. So we were completing each other. That&#8217;s sounds very good, huh?<!--more-->

Time after time, our collaboration between AmazingMilk and that agency founded by AmazingMilk&#8217;s co-founders had begun not so good. Me and Andika thought there were something wrong with the management. Especially the finance management, but it is just like the tip of the iceberg, the problem itself was more complicated than that. Short story, 4 of us held a board meeting, and deal some new partnership terms. But in a few months after that meeting, both of me and Andika felt a bad feeling, we thought there were nothing change, and the new partnership terms still not worked very well.

We held a board meeting anymore, oh not only one meeting, but several meetings. But still not change this bad condition. I was bored and exhausted, Andika also got the same feeling. So, we decided to end up this partnership. We kicked out that 2 co-founders from the board, and then AmazingMilk was running by both of us.

But 1 month ago, we decided to re-brand this digital agency, because our vision was changing and we didn&#8217;t want if this digital agency is correlating with that ex-co-founders. So, after thinking very deeply. We decided to use Froyo (it&#8217;s a frozen yoghurt), as the new name. Why yoghurt? Why? Because yoghurt is an inheritance product of milk <img src="http://asep.co/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> We still love milk, but we want to drink a new one haha&#8230;

So, here we are Froyo, with a new spirit and a new vision, we will run again \o/

*disclaimer: For the sake of etiquette and respect, I don&#8217;t want to publish the name. I am considering this problem as a business lesson for myself <img src="http://asep.co/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> *
