Yay LDR band goes live. Eeeerr wait&#8230;.are you sure that&#8217;s a name of band? Yup, pretty sure. It&#8217;s a long distance relationship and recording, the band members are me and <a title="Fikri Rasyid's blog" href="http://fikrirasyid.com" target="_blank">Fikri Rasyid</a>, both of us are programmer and both of us have a long distance relationship with our girlfriend. I&#8217;m a back-end developer and Fikri is a front-end developer, and in this band our role seems like our daily job, Fikri as a vocalist and guitarist, and me as a synthesiser programmer and keyboardist.<!--more-->

Both of us never do the jam session together physically. We utilise Dropbox to do the jam session. We always put the audio track and Garage Band file in it (I hope there&#8217;s a versioning system like Git for music project). Now we got the opportunity to play live in a gig, on the real stage. We will play at November 16, 2013, in Bandung, West Java.

Here is the event detail:
