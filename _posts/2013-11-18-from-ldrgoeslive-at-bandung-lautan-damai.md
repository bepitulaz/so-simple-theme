Bandung, November 16, 2013 was an achievement for LDR, a long distance music recording project by Me and <a title="Follow Fikri Rasyid" href="http://twitter.com/fikrirasyid" target="_blank">Fikri Rasyid</a>. As I mentioned in <a title="LDR Goes Live: A Dropbox Jamming Band Get A Gig" href="http://asep.co/2013/11/ldr-goes-live-a-dropbox-jamming-band-get-a-gig/" target="_blank">this post</a>, we had been invited to play live at Bandung Lautan Damai event. An event to celebrate International Tolerance Day, the event was held at Museum Wangsit Mandala Siliwangi.<!--more-->

That night we played 2 songs, the first was Trouble by Coldplay, we covered it with LDR&#8217;s gloomy digital acoustic style and the second was Half Empty our own song. We played for 10 minutes. Not too much times, so we kept the rig setup very simple. Fikri&#8217;s gear is just a shiny new acoustic guitar, yes&#8230;new&#8230;he bought it in the morning before we did a check sound. My gear&#8217;s just an iPad and iPhone, I recorded some loops before, and loaded it up to Loopy HD app on my iPhone, and used the iPad with Korg iMS-20 and Alchemy for synthesizer.

Here is the video for the Half Empty song, not a full video, because the iPhone battery of Fikri&#8217;s girlfriend was half empty too <img src="http://asep.co/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />
